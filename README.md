Hi, hello, hiiii :3

# About Me
I'm MerchantCalico, I'm a girl from Australia who works on Minecraft mods and has a heavy interest in game design.
I'm also the owner and project lead of the Greenhouse Modding group, as well as the founder and an organizer of [Mod Garden](https://modgarden.net/).

- I've made Minecraft mods such as Bovines and Buttercups, and Farmer's Delight Refabricated. I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.
- I enjoy making things data driven.
- I have an interest in TTRPGs and games, usually platformers and RPGs.
- My pronouns are she/it/they.

You can view my mods [on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/Torty) or [on CurseForge.](https://www.curseforge.com/members/merchantcalico/projects)
You may donate to me [on Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/merchantcalico), but please only do so if you're in a financially stable position.

The best place to reach me is through Discord, as I'm quite active there, @merchantcalico.
