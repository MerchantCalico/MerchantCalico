# Hi what's up.

I'm MerchantPug, I'm a girl from Australia who works on Minecraft mods and has a heavy interest in game design.
I'm also the owner and project lead of the Greenhouse Modding group.

- I've made Minecraft mods such as Bovines and Buttercups, TooManyOrigins and Apugli and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.
- I enjoy making things data driven.
- I have an interest in non D&D TTRPGs and games, usually platformers and RPGs.
- My pronouns are she/her.

You can view my mods on Modrinth [here.](https://modrinth.com/user/Pug)

The best place to reach me is through Discord, as I'm quite active there.
